# testing-standards

A research project into what software testing standards exist and why they widely ignored by the software industry at large.

The most well-known published standard is ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 (http://www.softwaretestingstandard.org/index.php), unfortunately it's standards are not publicly available, you have to pay for it to learn it or criticize it and that was my primary objection to it: http://www.kenst.com/2014/08/please-sign-the-petition-to-stop-iso-29119/. Never the less I'd like to read it and others to understand what / if any value they provide.

Goal:

Perhaps after this project is over I'll have a better suggestion of where to start on the standardization front.
